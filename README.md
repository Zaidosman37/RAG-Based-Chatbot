# RAG Based Chatbot

This is a Chatbot that is being created using RAG to understand how the working of AI model can be modified to improve user- bot experience.

Various Kinds of modules such as langchain, google.generative ai , streamlit, pypdf and user defined functions are being used to extract data and implement them in analysis.

The Whole idea is to create a chatbot that can understand a certain pdf , then start a normal one on one conversations with the user based on user's questions.

This model was deployed online using streamlit.

This Program is a mixture of python, streamlit and prompt engineering.

Thank you,
